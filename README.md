### 🚀 OSS (The Hits)
- **[Prof](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/prof)** - Making profiling less of a prof-anity.
- **[GenPool](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/GenPool)** - An object pool that's actually-generic-and-useful.
- **[GoFlow](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/GoFlow)** - Because sometimes you need to see where your code is procrastinating.

### 🧪 Businesses
- **[Name_Pending](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/Pending)** (🚧 *In Development*) - Making it radically simpler for open-source maintainers to find the right help and for developers to prove their skills.*...or I'm just building the most elaborate graveyard entry yet.*

### ⚰️ Businesses Graveyard
*Ideas so promising they almost convinced me to buy a Patagonia vest.*
- **[PromptMash](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/Promptmesh)** - I built agent pipelining. Then I discovered n8n.
- **[GhostDev](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/GhostDev)** - An "agentic system" to spawn and coordinate AI teams. The main coordination problem turned out to be keeping my ambition in check with reality.

### ⚰️ OSS Graveyard (The "Learning Experiences")
*Here lie ideas that were... ahead of their time. Or behind. Mostly just behind.*
- **[prof_ai](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/prof_py)** - For when you want your profiling to take 100x longer and be 0% more helpful.
- **[PoolX](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/PoolX)** - I got really, *really* excited about not allocating memory. It was a phase.
- **[Memora](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/Memora)** - A management system for multiple PoolX instances. It solved the problem of "what if you need a second PoolX" which, it turns out, is a problem that precedes the problem of "why are you using PoolX in the first place?" 🔄➡️🗑️
- **[TokenSpan](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/TokenSpan)** - A "revolutionary" prompt hack. It was neither revolutionary, nor much of a hack.
- **[GoCortex](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/GoCortex)** - Taught an AI to be my intern. It spent most of its time generating excuses. 🤖❌
- **[IdleSpy](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/IdleSpy)** & **[Yieldpoint](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/Yieldpoint)** - Incredibly niche solutions for problems that may not actually exist.

### 📖 More About Me
1. I dissect my projects—both the hits and the misses—as technical experiments. I write about the insights on [Medium](https://alexsanderhamir.medium.com) and discuss them on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Safe-Programmer2826/submitted/).
2. I like treating everything as an experiment, so you're just doing me a favor when you tell me that I am wrong.
