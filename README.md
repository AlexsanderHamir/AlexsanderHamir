# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alexsander!
Iâ€™m a systems-focused engineer with a deep interest in building software that performs at scale and respects the underlying hardware it runs on.

I specialize in crafting high-performance infrastructures with a strong emphasis on resource efficiency, HFT-level performance, scalable system architecture, and green energy principles. My work blends low-level understanding (such as OS internals and CPU architecture) with high-level system design (like distributed databases and orchestration) to build systems that are not only fast and reliable, but sustainable.

My mission is simple: to build systems that scale responsibly â€” fast, efficient, and energy-aware.
