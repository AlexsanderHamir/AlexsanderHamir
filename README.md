### 🛠️ Main Open Source Projects

> These are the tools I use most in my own work—each built to solve real pain points I encountered while working on high-performance Go systems.


- **[Prof](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/prof)** – *Streamlines Go profiling by wrapping `pprof` with automation and AI-powered insights for faster, more actionable performance analysis.*
- **[GenPool](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/GenPool)** – *Fast, flexible object pool that combines the speed of `sync.Pool` with control over when and how memory is reclaimed.*
- **[GoFlow](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/GoFlow)** – *Visualizes and tests pipeline stages to help model, debug, and optimize data processing systems in Go.*

### 🛠️ Specialized Tools for Niche Problems
> These projects were developed to address specific challenges I encountered while exploring various database technical concepts.
* **[IdleSpy](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/IdleSpy)** – *Tracks goroutine concurrency stats at the select case level and generates insightful graphs.*
* **[yieldpoint](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/yieldpoint)** – *Cooperative goroutine yielding with priority-aware scheduling for low-latency Go systems.*
* **[Ring Buffer](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/ring_buffer)** – *Thread-safe generic ring buffer for efficient circular storage.*
* **[PoolX](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/PoolX)** – *Generic Go object pool with fine-grained lifecycle control.*
* **[Memora](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/Memora)** – *Lightweight manager for related Go object pools with context grouping.*
