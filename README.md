### ‚ö∞Ô∏è OSS Graveyard (The "Learning Experiences")
*Here lie ideas that were... ahead of their time. Or behind. Mostly just behind.*
- **[prof_ai](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/prof_py)** - For when you want your profiling to take 100x longer and be 0% more helpful.
- **[PoolX](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/PoolX)** - I got really, *really* excited about not allocating memory. It was a phase.
- **[Memora](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/Memora)** - A management system for multiple PoolX instances. It solved the problem of "what if you need a second PoolX".
- **[GoCortex](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/GoCortex)** - A more complex engine for prof_ai that didn't do anything special.
- **[IdleSpy](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/IdleSpy)** & **[Yieldpoint](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/Yieldpoint)** - Incredibly niche solutions for problems that may not actually exist for most people.
- **[GhostDev](https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/GhostDev)** - A "first-mover" in the emergent autonomous agent orchestration space.
### üìñ More About Me
1. I dissect my projects‚Äîboth the hits and the misses‚Äîas technical experiments. I write about the insights on [Medium](https://alexsanderhamir.medium.com) and discuss them on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Safe-Programmer2826/submitted/).
2. I like treating everything as an experiment, so you're just doing me a favor when you tell me that I am wrong.
