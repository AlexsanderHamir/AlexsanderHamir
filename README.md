## Hi, I’m Alexander 👋

I specialize in low-latency production systems.

I’m typically brought in when:
- Latency is measured in seconds and needs to be measured in milliseconds  
- p99 is hurting real users  
- Throughput collapses under load  

I’ve applied this work to:
- Inference layers (serving and routing ML models)  
- Query engines  
- Trading systems  
- Storage engines  

Recent work includes:
- 20×–50× latency reductions in production systems  
- Scaling systems to 30K+ RPS  
- Building profiling and benchmarking frameworks  

I focus on the bottlenecks that survive conventional optimizations.

I enjoy building and contributing to open source software.
