# 👋 Hi, I'm Alexsander!
From January 2022 to February 2025, I taught myself computer science. Along the way, I became deeply interested in building software that’s efficient and lightweight. That interest came from a growing frustration — modern software keeps getting bloated for no good reason. Despite constant improvements in hardware, software quality seems to be going in the opposite direction.

That’s why I chose to learn the following:
- **Knowledge Domains:** Databases, Distributed Systems  
- **Interests:** Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Algorithm Design  
- **Specialties:** Resource Efficiency, HFT Systems, Green Software Practices

And that's why I chose to build open source projects that address this challenge. It's difficult to create resource-efficient software when speed to market is a priority. My goal is to make it as easy as possible to develop fast, resource-efficient software—without sacrificing productivity.
