## Hi, I’m Alexander 👋

I specialize in low-latency, high-scale production systems.

Teams bring me in when:
- Latency is measured in seconds and needs to be measured in milliseconds  
- p99 is hurting real users  
- Systems collapse under real load  
- Performance issues start costing customers  

Recently, I:
- Led a competitive performance turnaround, moving from slowest to lowest latency among the top AI gateways and eliminating performance-driven churn  
- Served as primary technical lead for multi-region enterprise rollouts handling 30K–50K+ RPS  
- Reduced infrastructure by 38% while increasing scale capacity  
- Built production profiling and validation systems that reduced performance incidents by ~70–80%

I focus on the bottlenecks that survive conventional optimizations.

I enjoy building and contributing to open source software.
