## Hi, I’m Alexander 👋

I specialize in low-latency production systems.

I’m typically brought in when:
- Latency is measured in seconds and needs to be measured in milliseconds
- p99 is hurting real users
- Throughput collapses under load

I’ve applied this work to:
* Inference layers (Serving and routing ML models)
* Query engines 
* Trading systems 
* Storage engines

Recent work includes:
- 20×–50× latency reductions in production systems
- Scaling systems to 30K+ RPS
- Building profiling and benchmarking frameworks

I like solving the bottlenecks that survive conventional optimizations.
